<!-- I want to build and app and website for my smart devicemonitoring system. 
There are two actors: Users and Caretakers. Total tables in the database will be: 
1. User
2. Caretaker
3. Device
4. CCTV

For Device Table:

Device_ID is the Primary Key which is a Long Integer
Other attributes are:  Heartbeat, Temperature, BloodPressure, Oxygen Level, Accelerometer Data which will be calculated by the sensors present in the device.


For CCTV Table:
CCTVID is the Primary key which is again a Long Interger.

For USER Table:
User_ID will be the primary key.
Device_ID which is the foreign key from Watch Table. Every user has one-to-one relation with the Device and CCTV.
CCTV_ID which is again foreign key from CCTV Table
User_Name
User_Age
User_Password
User_Email
User_Contact_No
User_Image_URL

For Caretaker Table

Caretaker_ID will be the primary key.
User_ID is the foreign key. And Caretaker has one to may relation with USER table. A single caretaker can be related to one or more users.
Caretaker_Name
Caretaker_Email
Caretaker_Password
Caretaker_Contact_No
Caretaker_Image_URL


I want to use NodeJs, ExpressJS, MongoDB to create the database.

Flow of the project is:
1. User registers on website.
2. Then logs in on app.
3. Start the devices in pairing mode.
4. And connect to the devices using Bluetooth from the app.
5. Then credentials are shared and the device sends a unique ID (Mac Id or anything) to the app.
6. The app sends this ID to the database (mapping ID to the user).
7. All the data sent to database will have the unique I'd associated.
8. Livestream can be accessed through this id.
